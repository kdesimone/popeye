What is a population receptive field?
======================================

A population receptive field (pRF) is a quantitative model of the cumulative response 
of the population of cells contained within a single fMRI voxel [1]_.  The pRF model can 
be used to estimate the response properties of populations of neurons using other measures, such
as EcOG and EEG [2]_.

The pRF model allows us to interpret and predict the responses of a voxel to different stimuli. 
Such models can be designed to describe various sensory [3]_ and cognitive [4]_ processes.  More 
recently, we have used the pRF model to map the retinotopic organization of multiple subcortical 
nuclei [5]_.
